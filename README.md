# Housing-Dataset-Analysis
at first I answered some questions on this data.
at the next step of The data preprocessing, I checked for nulls and then update this null values with mean or median if the data is Numerical
and with mode if data is categorical. then I checked for outliers using boxplot and used MINMAX Scaler to scale data (between 0 and 1)
finally I checked for Duplicates.
